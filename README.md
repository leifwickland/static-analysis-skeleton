See the [companion slides](http://tinyurl.com/pnwslint) for the talk given at [PNWScala 2014](http://pnwscala.org/2014/index.html).

See `src/main/scala/BadThings.scala` for examples of analysis. Individually uncomment lines to see the various tools in
action.  In `sbt`, run `compile`, `lint:compile`, and `scalastyle` to see the effects of static anaylsis.

To slurp linting into your project, copy `lint.sbt` and `project/lint.sbt`.
